Chat Room
===
The goal of this workshop is to get along with React learning by doing.

In order to do so, we will make a chat application.

Part 1
----
We will create:

1. The app (the wrapper of our components),
2. The chat room component that will manage messages and render them,
3. The message component.

Messages are stubbed and static for this first session.

What we have to do:

* Load the stubbed messages,
* Render them,
* Create a form to write and to submit messages,
* Style the application keeping in mind we want to be able to display on all kind of devices
